They work in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) using tools like SIEM platforms to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time. Security Analysts are the first line of defense against cyber attacks, ensuring networks and systems remain secure.'

      question: 'What makes SOC Analyst different from Penetration Tester?',
      answer: 'SOC Analysts focus on defense - monitoring systems, detecting threats, and responding to incidents to protect organizations. Penetration Testers focus on offense - actively trying to break into systems to find vulnerabilities. SOC Analysts work continuously in shifts monitoring security, while pentesters conduct periodic assessments. Both are important cybersecurity roles but have different skill sets. This course focuses on defensive security and SOC operations. If you enjoy monitoring, analysis, and incident response, SOC Analyst role is perfect for you.'
